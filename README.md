## Project Overview

A dockerized sentiment analysis service. Built with FastAPI, it utilizes NLP classifiers to assess text sentiment, caching results in Redis and logging requests to PostgreSQL.

## Problem Statement

Traditional implementations in this domain often suffer from scalability limits, complex runtime configurations, and poor modular structure. When scaling codebases, developer workflows slow down due to overlapping concerns, untracked dependencies, and insufficient validation boundaries.

## Motivation & Objectives

This repository is designed as a template for professional codebases, focusing on:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear separation between ingestion pipelines, business modules, and delivery targets.
- **Developer Experience:** Clean configurations, predefined testing structures, and quick local setup steps.
- **Production Readiness:** Configured CI checks, robust logging formats, and clean dependency version pinning.

## Core Features

- FastAPI endpoint predicting text sentiment categories.
- Redis caching layer returning instant results for duplicate queries.
- PostgreSQL database logging request histories and analytical metrics.
- Docker Compose setup packaging app, database, and cache containers.
- Web interface showing sentiment trends and log statistics.

## Technical Flow & Execution

The user submits text. The app checks Redis for a cached result. If missed, the NLP classifier predicts the sentiment, caches the result in Redis, logs the request to PostgreSQL, and returns the prediction.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pip package manager

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Manirider/Sentiment-Analysis-Platform.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-Platform

# Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies locally
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required library dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution

```bash
python main.py
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

We maintain code stability through automated verification routines:
- **Linting Verification:** All commits are checked against styling rules using standard code formatting checkers.
- **Unit Verification:** Test suites validate core execution paths, mocking external resource targets.
- **Coverage Audits:** Ensure new files follow unit test coverage standards before requesting pull request reviews.

Execute checks using the following commands:
- **Python Lints:** `flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics`
- **Python Tests:** `pytest tests/ --tb=short`
- **JS/TS Lints:** `npm run lint`
- **JS/TS Tests:** `npm run test`

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Configuration Errors

1. **Dependency Installation Mismatch:**
   - **Problem:** Installation conflicts between lock files and newer runtime environment updates.
   - **Resolution:** Rebuild virtual environments or delete `node_modules`, verifying package-lock or requirements ranges match target versions.
   
2. **Missing Environment Keys:**
   - **Problem:** Access errors on startup due to unconfigured secret paths.
   - **Resolution:** Ensure `.env` config variables are created in the project root following template guidelines.

3. **Database Connection Terminated:**
   - **Problem:** Connection timeouts or database access errors.
   - **Resolution:** Verify Postgres/Redis instances are running in the background and confirm port configurations are accessible.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **How is project configuration managed?**
  Settings are loaded dynamically from environment variables and config files to keep parameters separated from code logic.
  
- **Can I run this project in a containerized environment?**
  Yes, a Dockerfile setup is provided to build container images for isolated execution.
  
- **What is the contribution review turnaround SLA?**
  Pull requests are evaluated and reviewed by maintainers within 3 business days.
